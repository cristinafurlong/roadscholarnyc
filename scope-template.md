## Product Name

The Road Scholar guide to school safety & pedestrian issues in your neighborhood. NYC! 

## Goal

This mapping tool will help community members look at their geographic area with key insights into the enrollment numbers at local schools, the police precincts that attend their needs, and the number of car collisions that have happened on specific streets. The map will make it easy to access key information which will inform their discussions about traffic safety. The map will be the "Big Picture" that people in government, the department of education and in local schools are missing in their discussions of school safety. Pedestrian safety issues can be addressed more easily by just having access to the key data and school locations provided. 

## Key Users
School administrators- Principals, PTA leaders, Parent Coordinators, Parents and community groups. 



## Features
School location, and after school locations, including Universal Pre-Kindergarten seats.
Student enrollment numbers at each school. 
Map area will cover the borough of Queens.
There will be a crowdsourcing tool, so that users can submit the locations of crossing guards in their neighborhood. This will be a form, at a separate URL.
Users will be able to access their neighborhood of interest by typing in zip code.

Cleaning up data from above links. 
Finding Precinct and crossing guard info. 
Hoping to also input collision data

## Tabled ideas
Additional features and interactivity that got scrapped:           
A complaint form which would link to NYC's 311 online complaint forms.            
A forum section, where users could rant and rave about their specific issues.                
A section that would list updates based on the complaints in the forum.
